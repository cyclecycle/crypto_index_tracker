# Notes on exchanges #
These are exchanges I have attempted to make accounts with, so this also serves as a whitelist as I have researched many more and deemed
them untrustworthy.

### GDAX ###
Works reliably.

### Kraken ###
Very unreliable when site is busy. Will time out or accuse you of spam often.  

Use https://status.kraken.com/ to check site status. If response time >1400ms it craps out. Could maybe automate this check?

### Binance ###
Site seems reliable but currently won't connect to ccxt. The ccxt guy is working on a fix.

### BitTrex ###
[Currently not able to make new accounts]

### Bitfinex ###
[Currently not able to make new accounts]

### Abucoin ###
Small exchange not supported by ccxt. Using to hold SC until I can make a BitTrex account.

### Gatecoin ###
[untested]

### Exmo ###
[untested]

### Bitstamp ###
[untested]
